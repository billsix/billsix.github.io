<h2>Welcome to Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-programming" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I love programming. I enjoy the challenge to not only make a working
program, but to do so with style. Programming is like poetry. It conveys
a message, not only to the computer, but to those who modify and use
your program. With a program, you build your own world with your own
rules. You create your world according to your conception of both the
problem and the solution. Masterful programmers create worlds with
programs that are clear and succinct, much like a poem or essay.</p>
<p>One of the greatest programmers, Donald Knuth, describes programming not
as telling a computer how to do something, but telling a person how they
would instruct a computer to do something. The point is that programs
are meant to be read by people, not just computers. Your programs will
be modified and updated by others long after you move on to other
projects. Thus, programming is not as much about communicating to a
computer as it is communicating to those who come after you. A
programmer is a problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at once.
Your goal is to solve the problem at hand, doing so with balance and
taste, and teach your solution to future programmers. I hope that this
book can teach at least some of the poetry and magic that makes
computing exciting.</p>
<p>Most introductory books on programming frustrate me to no end. At the
end of them you can still ask “how does the computer really work?” and
not have a good answer. They tend to pass over topics that are difficult
even though they are important. I will take you through the difficult
issues because that is the only way to move on to masterful programming.
My goal is to take you from knowing nothing about programming to
understanding how to think, write, and learn like a programmer. You
won’t know everything, but you will have a background for how everything
fits together. At the end of this book, you should be able to do the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand how a program works and interacts with other programs</p></li>
<li><p>Read other people’s programs and learn how they work</p></li>
<li><p>Learn new programming languages quickly</p></li>
<li><p>Learn advanced concepts in computer science quickly</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will not teach you everything. Computer science is a massive field,
especially when you combine the theory with the practice of computer
programming. However, I will attempt to get you started on the
foundations so you can easily go wherever you want afterwards.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem in teaching programming,
especially assembly language. There is a lot to learn - it is almost too
much to learn almost at all at once. However, each piece depends on all
the others, which makes learning it a piece at a time difficult.
Therefore, you must be patient with yourself and the computer while
learning to program. If you don’t understand something the first time,
reread it. If you still don’t understand it, it is sometimes best to
take it by faith and come back to it later. Often after more exposure to
programming the ideas will make more sense. Don’t get discouraged. It’s
a long climb, but very worthwhile.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter are three sets of review exercises. The first
set is more or less regurgitation - they check to see if can you give
back what you learned in the chapter. The second set contains
application questions - they check to see if you can apply what you
learned to solve problems. The final set is to see if you are capable of
broadening your horizons. Some of these questions may not be answerable
until later in the book, but they give you some things to think about.
Other questions require some research into outside sources to discover
the answer. Still others require you to simply analyze your options and
explain a best solution. Many of the questions don’t have right or wrong
answers, but that doesn’t mean they are unimportant. Learning the issues
involved in programming, learning how to research answers, and learning
how to look ahead are all a major part of a programmer’s work.</p>
<p>If you have problems that you just can’t get past, there is a mailing
list for this book where readers can discuss and get help with what they

<p>If you are thinking of using this book for a class on computer
programming but do not have access to Linux computers for your students,
I highly suggest you try to find help from the K-12 Linux Project. Their
website is at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.k12linux.org/">http://www.k12linux.org/</a> and they have a helpful and

<h2>Your Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#your-tools" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book teaches assembly language for x86 processors and the GNU/Linux
operating system. Therefore we will be giving all of the examples using
the GNU/Linux standard GCC tool set. If you are not familiar with
GNU/Linux and the GCC tool set, they will be described shortly. If you
are new to Linux, you should check out the guide available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://rute.sourceforge.net/">http://rute.sourceforge.net/</a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> What I intend to show you is more
about programming in general than using a specific tool set on a
specific platform, but standardizing on one makes the task much easier.</p>
<p>Those new to Linux should also try to get involved in their local
GNU/Linux User’s Group. User’s Group members are usually very helpful
for new people, and will help you from everything from installing Linux
to learning to use it most efficiently. A listing of GNU/Linux User’s
Groups is available at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux.org/groups/">http://www.linux.org/groups/</a></p>
<p>All of these programs have been tested using Red Hat Linux 8.0, and
should work with any other GNU/Linux distribution, too. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> They will
not work with non-Linux operating systems such as BSD or other systems.
However, all of the <em>skills</em> learned in this book should be easily
transferable to any other system.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to a GNU/Linux machine, you can look for a
hosting provider who offers a Linux <em>shell account</em>, which is a
command-line only interface to a Linux machine. There are many low-cost
shell account providers, but you have to make sure that they match the
requirements above (i.e. - Linux on x86). Someone at your local
GNU/Linux User’s Group may be able to give you one as well. Shell
accounts only require that you already have an Internet connection and a
telnet program. If you use Windows, you already have a telnet client -
just click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run</span></code>, then type in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">telnet</span></code>. However,
it is usually better to download PuTTY from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.chiart.greenend.co.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiart.greenend.co.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a> because Windows’
telnet has some weird problems. There are a lot of options for the
Macintosh, too. NiftyTelnet is my favorite.</p>
<p>If you don’t have GNU/Linux and can’t find a shell account service, then
you can download Knoppix from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.knoppix.org/">http://www.knoppix.org/</a> Knoppix is a
GNU/Linux distribution that boots from CD so that you don’t have to
actually install it. Once you are done using it, you just reboot and
remove the CD and you are back to your regular operating system.</p>
<p>So what is GNU/Linux? GNU/Linux is an operating system modeled after
UNIX. The GNU part comes from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU
Project</a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, which includes most of the
programs you will run, including the GCC tool set that we will use to
program with. The GCC tool set contains all of the programs necessary to
create programs in various computer languages.</p>
<p>Linux is the name of the <em>kernel</em>. The kernel is the core part of an
operating system that keeps track of everything. The kernel is both a
fence and a gate. As a gate, it allows programs to access hardware in a
uniform way. Without the kernel, you would have to write programs to
deal with every device model ever made. The kernel handles all
device-specific interactions so you don’t have to. It also handles file
access and interaction between processes. For example, when you type,
your typing goes through several programs before it hits your editor.
First, the kernel is what handles your hardware, so it is the first to
receive notice about the keypress. The keyboard sends in <em>scancodes</em> to
the kernel, which then converts them to the actual letters, numbers, and
symbols they represent. If you are using a windowing system (like
Microsoft Windows or the X Window System), then the windowing system
reads the keypress from the kernel, and delivers it to whatever program
is currently in focus on the user’s display.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Keyboard</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Kernel</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Windowing</span> <span class="n">system</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Application</span> <span class="n">program</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The kernel also controls the flow of information between programs. The
kernel is a program’s gate to the world around it. Every time that data
moves between processes, the kernel controls the messaging. In our
keyboard example above, the kernel would have to be involved for the
windowing system to communicate the keypress to the application program.</p>
<p>As a fence, the kernel prevents programs from accidentally overwriting
each other’s data and from accessing files and devices that they don’t
have permission to. It limits the amount of damage a poorly-written
program can do to other running programs.</p>
<p>In our case, the kernel is Linux. Now, the kernel all by itself won’t do
anything. You can’t even boot up a computer with just a kernel. Think of
the kernel as the water pipes for a house. Without the pipes, the
faucets won’t work, but the pipes are pretty useless if there are no
faucets. Together, the user applications (from the GNU project and other
places) and the kernel (Linux) make up the entire operating system,
GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>For the most part, this book will be using the computer’s low-level
assembly language. There are essentially three kinds of languages:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Machine Language</dt><dd><p>This is what the computer actually sees and deals with. Every command
the computer sees is given as a number or sequence of numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assembly Language</dt><dd><p>This is the same as machine language, except the command numbers have
been replaced by letter sequences which are easier to memorize. Other
small things are done to make it easier as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>High-Level Language</dt><dd><p>High-level languages are there to make programming easier. Assembly
language requires you to work with the machine itself. High-level
languages allow you to describe the program in a more natural
language. A single command in a high-level language usually is
equivalent to several commands in an assembly language.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this book we will learn assembly language, although we will cover a
bit of high-level languages. Hopefully by learning assembly language,
your understanding of how programming and computers work will put you a
step ahead.</p>

<p>This is quite a large document. You certainly don’t need to know
everything to get started with this book. You simply need to know how
to navigate from the command line and how to use an editor like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pico</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">emacs</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vi</span></code> (or others).</p>
