<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.</span> <span class="pre">PREAMBLE</span></code></p>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying
it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
others.</p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.</span> <span class="pre">APPLICABILITY</span> <span class="pre">AND</span> <span class="pre">DEFINITIONS</span></code></p>
<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
terms of this License. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual
or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
“you”.</p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not “Transparent” is
called “Opaque”.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some
word processors for output purposes only.</p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2.</span> <span class="pre">VERBATIM</span> <span class="pre">COPYING</span></code></p>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3.</span> <span class="pre">COPYING</span> <span class="pre">IN</span> <span class="pre">QUANTITY</span></code></p>
<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4.</span> <span class="pre">MODIFICATIONS</span></code></p>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>A</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
original publisher of that version gives permission.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>B</strong></p>
</div>
<p>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>C</strong></p>
</div>
<p>State on the Title Page the name of the publisher of the Modified
Version, as the publisher.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
to the other copyright notices.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>G</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>H</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Preserve the section entitled “History”, and its title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no
section entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the
title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
stated in the previous sentence.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>J</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit
a network location for a work that was published at least four years
before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
version it refers to gives permission.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>K</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In any section entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, preserve
the section’s title, and preserve in the section all the substance
and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>L</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
not considered part of the section titles.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>M</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Delete any section entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="formalpara-title docutils container">
<p><strong>N</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Do not retitle any existing section as “Endorsements” or to conflict
in title with any Invariant Section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties–for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version .</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5.</span> <span class="pre">COMBINING</span> <span class="pre">DOCUMENTS</span></code></p>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled “History” in
the various original documents, forming one section entitled “History”;
likewise combine any sections entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any
sections entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections entitled
“Endorsements.”</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6.</span> <span class="pre">COLLECTIONS</span> <span class="pre">OF</span> <span class="pre">DOCUMENTS</span></code></p>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and dispbibute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">7.</span> <span class="pre">AGGREGATION</span> <span class="pre">WITH</span> <span class="pre">INDEPENDENT</span> <span class="pre">WORKS</span></code></p>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation. Such a compilation is called an “aggregate”, and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document , on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text
requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,
then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate,
the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only
the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8.</span> <span class="pre">TRANSLATION</span></code></p>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
original English version of this License, the original English version
will prevail.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">9.</span> <span class="pre">TERMINATION</span></code></p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10.</span> <span class="pre">FUTURE</span> <span class="pre">REVISIONS</span> <span class="pre">OF</span> <span class="pre">THIS</span> <span class="pre">LICENSE</span></code></p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addendum</span></code></p>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Copyright YEAR YOUR NAME.</p>
<p>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with the
Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of
the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free
Documentation License”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write “with no Invariant Sections”
instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write “no Front-Cover Texts” instead of “Front-Cover Texts being
LIST”; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.</p>
