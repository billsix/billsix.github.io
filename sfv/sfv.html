      In fighting games, a successful player is able to string together
      multiple attacks which, once started, the opponent is unable to defend.
      Since this string of attacks does much more damage to the opponent
      than a series of stray hits (i.e. one attack followed by a pause,
      thus allowing
      the opponent either to block or to counter-attack), a player who
      knows combos well is
      at a significant advantage over one who does not.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      How does one interested in combos learn them?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Mainly, combos are put into lists; but there is a problem with that
      approach.
      Each character has many combos, many of which have common substrings.
      To list out every combo would have too much repetition to be reasonable.
      Experienced players can look at a long combo and instinctively deduce
      sub-combos which can be used in a different context (i.e., a listed combo
      that start with a jumping HP followed by standing MP, can also just start
      at standing MP).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But how does a novice who lacks experience learn from these condense lists?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Here, I attempt alleviate some of the aforementioned problems for the novice
      and experienced player alike  by representing combos using
      Deterministic Finite Automata.
      Nodes surrounded by squares represent starting states/distances. Nodes
      surrounded by circles represent moves, and arrows point to new moves
      which may be linked/canceled from the previous move.  Nodes surrounded
      by two circles are "end states".
