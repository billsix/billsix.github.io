Rotations - Demo 07
===================


Purpose
^^^^^^^

Attempt to rotate the paddles around their center.
Learn about rotations.  This demo does not
work correctly, because of a misunderstanding
of how to interprete a sequence of transformations.

Rotate the Paddles About their Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides translate and scale, the third main operation in computer
graphics is to rotate an object.


Rotation Around Origin (0,0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can rotate an object around (0,0) by rotating
all of the object's vertices around (0,0).

.. figure:: static/rotate0.gif
    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate


In high school math, you will have learned about sin, cos, and tangent.
Typically the angles are described on the unit circle, where a rotation
starts from the positive x axis.

We can expand on this knowledge, allowing
us to rotate a given vertex, wherever it is, around the origin (0,0).  This is done
by separating the x and y value, rotating each component seperately,
and then adding the results together.

That might not have been fully clear.  Let me try again.
The vertex (0.5,0.4) can be separated into two vertices, (0.5,0) and (0,0.4).

    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate


These vertices can be added together to create the original vertex.
But, before we do that, let's rotate each of the vertices.

(0.5,0) is on the x-axis, so rotating it by "angle" degrees, results
in vertex (0.5*cos(angle), 0.5*sin(angle)).  This is high school
geometry, and won't be explained here in detail.

.. figure:: static/rotate.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate the x component.

.. figure:: static/cc0/Stephan_Kulla/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_2.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 07
    :figclass: align-center




But what may not be obvious, is what happens to the y component?
Turns out, it's easy.  Just rotate your point of view, and it's
the same thing, with one minor difference, in that the x value
is negated.





.. figure:: static/rotate2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate the y component

.. figure:: static/cc0/Stephan_Kulla/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_3.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 07
    :figclass: align-center


(0,0.4) is on the y-axis, so rotating it by "angle" degrees, results
in vertex (0.4*-sin(angle), 0.4*cos(angle)).


Wait.  Why is negative sin applied to the angle to make the x value,
and cos applied to angle to make the y value?  It's because positive
1 unit on the x axis goes downwards.  The top of the plot is in
units of -1.


After the rotations have been applied, sum the results to
get your vertex rotated around the origin!

(0.5*cos(angle), 0.5*sin(angle)) + (0.4*-sin(angle), 0.4*cos(angle)) =
(0.5*cos(angle) + 0.4*-sin(angle), 0.5*sin(angle) + 0.4*cos(angle))

So to rotate paddle 1 about its center,
we should translate to its position, and then rotate
around the paddle's center.

Likewise, to rotate paddle 2 about its center,
we should translate to its position, and then rotate
around the paddle's center.

Why it's Wrong
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Turns out, our program doesn't work as predicted, even though
translate, scale, and rotate are all defined correctly.  The paddles
are not rotating around their center.

Let's take a look in detail about what our paddlespace to
world space transformations are doing.

So then what the heck are we supposed to do in order to
rotate around an object's center?  The next section
provides a solution.
