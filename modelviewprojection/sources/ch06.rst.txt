Modelspace
^^^^^^^^^^


Normalized-device-coordinates are not a natural system of
numbers for use by humans.  Imagine that the paddles in the previous
chapters exist in real life, and are 20 meters wide and 60 meters tall.
The graphics programmer should be able to use those numbers directly;
they shouldn't have to manually transform the distances into normalized-device-coordinates.

Whatever a convenient numbering system is (i.e. coordinate system) for modeling objects
is called "model-space".  Since a paddle has four corners, which corner should be at
the origin (0,0)?  If you don't already know what you want at the origin, then
none of the corners should be; instead put the center of the object
at the origin (Because by putting the center of the object at the origin,
scaling and rotating the object are trivial, as shown in later chapters).

    Representing a Paddle using Modelspace


Modelspace - the coordinate system (origin plus axises), in which some object's
verticies are defined.


WorldSpace
^^^^^^^^^^

WorldSpace is a toplevel space, independent of NDC, that we choose to use.  It's arbitrary.
If you were to model a racetrack for a racing game, the origin of WorldSpace may be the center of that racetrack.
If you were modelling our solar system, the center of the sun could be the origin of "WorldSpace".

For our demo with paddles, the author arbitralily defines the WorldSpace to be 200 units wide, 200 units tall, with the origin at the center.

Modelspace to WorldSpace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model-space to World-space.

The author prefers to view transformations as changes to the graph paper,
as compared to view tranformations as changes to points.

As such, for placing paddle1, we can view the translation as a change
to the graph paper relative to world space coordinates (only incidentally
bringing the vertices
along with it) and then resetting the graph paper back to it's original position and orientation.
Although we will think of the paddle's vertices as relative to its own space
(i.e. -10 to 10 horizontally, -30 to 30 vertically),
we will not look at the numbers of what they are in world space coordinates,
as doing so

* Will not give us any insight

* Will distract us from thinking clearly about what's happening

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Paddle 1's graph paper gets translated -90 units in the x direction, and some
number of units in the y direction, 0 during the first frame, based off of user input.  The origin
is translated, and the graph paper comes with it, onto which you can
plot the vertices.  Notice that the coordinate system below and to the left
is unchanged.  That is world space, which has not changed.

Now that the transformation has happened, the vertices are all in world space.
Please don't look at the numbers, they will give you no insight.  The only numbers
that matter for insight as that the entire graph paper of modelspace, which originally
was the same as world space, has changed, brining the verticies along with it.

Same goes for Paddle 2's modelspace, relative to it's translation, which
are different values.

   Instead, for model-space to world-space transformations,
   it's easier to read the transformations backwards, where the transformations
   aren't relative to the global origin, instead it's from the local frame of reference.

   When reading the transformations backwards, I think it's best to think of it
   as moving the axises, and the plotting the data once the axies are in
   their final place.


   Why do the two different views of the transformations matter?  In model-space
   to world-space transformations, especially once rotation and scaling of model-space
   is used, it allows the programmer to forget about most details, just specify
   where new objects are relative to that which you are already drawing.

   With that said, that doesn't mean that reading the transformations front to back
   has no value.  Front to back can useful when dealing with cameraspace transformations,
   introduced later.

   This will make more sense once rotation is involved.


Scaling
~~~~~~~

Our paddles are now well outside of NDC, and as such, they would not
be displayed, as they would be *clipped* out.  Their values are outside
of -1.0 to 1.0.  All we will need to do to convert them from
world space to NDC is divide each component, x and y, by 100.

As a demonstration of how scaling works, let's make an
object's width twice as large, and height three times as large. (The author
tried doing the actual scaling in an animated gif, and it looked awful,
therefore a different scaling gif is showed here, but the concept
is the same).

We can expand or shrink the size of an object
by "scale"ing each component of the vertices by some coefficient.

Our global space is -100 to 100 in both dimesnions,
and to get it into NDC, we need to scale by dividing by 100

    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{w} \\
    y_{w}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}


where x_p1, y_p1  are the modelspace coordinates of the paddle's vertices,
and where p1_center_x_worldspace, p1_center_y_worldspace,
are the offset from the world space's origin to the center of the paddle, i.e. the translation.



.. math::

    \begin{equation*}
    \vec{f}_{p2}^{w}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{p2} \\
    y_{p2}
    \end{bmatrix} =

    p2\text{_}center\text{_}x_{worldspace} \\
    p2\text{_}center\text{_}y_{worldspace}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}


Now, the coordinates for paddle 1 and for paddle 2 are in world
space, and we need the match to take any world space coordinates
and convert them to NDC.

    Reset coordinate system.


The coordinate system now resets back to the coordinate system specified
on the left and below.
Now, we must scale everything by 1/100.  I have
not included a picture of that here.  Scaling happens relative to
the origin, so the picture would be the same, just with different labels
on the bottom and on the left.
