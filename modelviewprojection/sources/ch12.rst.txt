    Demo 12


Code
^^^^


Make a variable to determine the angle that the square will be rotated.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 163
   :lines: 163

When 'q' is pressed, increase the angle.


.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 166
   :lines: 166-169

Event Loop
~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous chapter, this was the rendering code for
the square.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 235
   :lines: 235-249

Since we just want to add one rotation at the end of the sequence
of transformations from paddle 1 space to square space, just add
a rotate call at the top.



.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 240
   :lines: 240-254

The author is getting really tired of having to look at all the different
transformation functions repeatedly defined for each object being drawn.
