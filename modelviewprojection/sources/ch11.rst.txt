Relative Objects - Demo 11
==========================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Introduce relative objects, by making a small blue square
that is defined relative to the left paddle, but offset
some in the x direction.
When the paddle on the left moves or rotates, the blue square
moves with it, because it is defined relative to it.

How to Execute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux or on MacOS, in a shell, type "python src/demo11/demo.py".
On Windows, in a command prompt, type "python src\\demo11\\demo.py".

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^


Cayley Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the graph below, all we have added is "Square space", relative
to paddle 1 space.

    Demo 11

In the picture below, in 3D space, we see that the square has its
own modelspace (as evidenced by the 3 arrows), and we are going
to define its position and orientation relative to paddle 1.

Code
^^^^
..
   We in looking at the code for the three objects we are drawing
   you might notice that we are duplicating a lot of code, and
   that if we decide to change paddle1's transformations, that
   we would need to change the code in multiple places.
   Later demos will show how to handle this problem more gracefully.

Define the geometry of the square in it's own modelspace.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python

   :lines: 168-173


Event Loop
~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 218
   :lines: 218-218

    ...


Draw paddle 1, just as before.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 239
   :lines: 239-251

As a refresher, the author recommends reading the code from modelspace
to worldspace from the bottom up, and from worldspace to NDC from top down.

* TODO fix line nos
* Read line 239-240
* Read line 238
* Reset the coordinate system
* Read line 241-242
* Read line 243-244

New part!  Draw the square relative to the first paddle!
Translate the square to the right by 20 units.
We are dealing with a -100 to 100 world space, which
later gets scaled down to NDC.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 257
   :lines: 257-270

Towards that, we need to do all of the transformations to the square
that we would to the paddle, and then do any extra transformations
afterwards.

As such, read

* TODO fix line nums
* Read line 254-255
* Read line 253

If we were to plot the square now, it would be in paddle 1's space.  We don't want
that, we want in to be moved in the X direction some units.  Therefore

* TODO Fixd line nos
* Read line 251-252

Now the square's geometry will be in it's own space!

* TODO Fixd line nos
* Reset the coordinate system
* Read line 256-257, the inverse of the transformations from world space to camera space
* Read line 259-260, shrink the world space of -100, 100, down to NDC (-1 to 1)


Draw paddle 2 just like before.
