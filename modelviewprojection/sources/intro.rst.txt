Introduction
============

Learn how to program in 3D computer graphics in Python!




Approach
^^^^^^^^

This book uses "mistake-driven-development".  I show incrementally
how to build a more complex graphics application, making mistakes along
the way, and then fixing the mistakes.


Thoughout the book, I show how to place objects in space,
how to draw objects relative to other objects, how to add a
camera which moves over time based on user input, and how to transform all
the objects into the 2D pixel coordinates of the computer screen.
By the end of this book, you will understand the basics of
how to create first-person and third-person applications/games.
I made this book to show programmers how to make the kind
of graphics programs which they want to make, using
math they aleady know.

This book is purposely limited in scope, and
the applications produced are not particurly pretty nor realistic-looking.
For advanced graphics topics, you'll need to consult other references,
such as the OpenGL "red book" and "blue book".
Although this book fills a huge gap that other books do not address,
those other books are excellent reference books for advanced topics.

Required Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to install Python.  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Beginner%27s_Python_Tutorial/Installing_Python

Before running this code, you need a virtual environment,
with dependencies installed. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

On Windows, if you use the Developer command prompt, run

.. code-block::

   python -m venv venv
   cd venv\Scripts
   activate.bat
   cd ..\..\
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


If you use Visual Studio on Windows, it takes care of this for you.

On a Mac or on Linux, run

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


Windows
~~~~~~~

Use Visual Studio 2019 (Tested on community, but I'm sure it will work on others).

Linux
~~~~~

Install Python3, glfw via a package manager.  Use pip and virtualenv to install dependencies

Mac
~~~

Python Python3 (via anaconda, homebrew, macports, whatever), and use pip and virtualenv to install dependencies.
